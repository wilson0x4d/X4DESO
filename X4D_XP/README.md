# X4D **XP**

X4D XP is LibStub-compatible Add-On that reports XP gains.


## Features

- Outputs Experience Gains
- Shows XP/min
- Optionally shows Time-To-Level (ttl) 
- Optionally shows XP til-next-level (tnl)
- Can be integrated with via LibStub, and a callback can be set via **X4D_XP:RegisterCallback(color, text)**
- Supported by **X4D Chat** Add-On


## Planned

- If user is idle for 5 minutes or more, reset session start time and session count to avoid skew.

- Add support for guild/reputation gains (Fx. "Dark Brotherhood Points" -- new since I last explored the API)


## Installation

Open the Archive and copy the **X4D_XP** folder into **%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Elder Scrolls Online\live\Addons\** folder.

If ESO is already running, execute **/reloadui** command.

## Donations

I hope you enjoy using my add-ons as much as I enjoy creating them. If you want to show 
your support and donate :D I can always use in-game gold and items, and they're easy 
things to come by.

I am also a firm believer in Bitcoin, so if you really want to put a smile on my face 
send a Bitcoin donation (of ANY amount!) to <b><a href="bitcoin:1PeRYfrygTEo3VuJCQaZL5A43hrssRTNVH">1PeRYfrygTEo3VuJCQaZL5A43hrssRTNVH</a></b>,
you can use a service like <a href="https://www.coinbase.com">Coinbase</a> to purchase 
and send bitcoin if you don't already have a bitcoin wallet.
