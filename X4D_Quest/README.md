# X4D **Quest**

## Features

-Used by X4D **MiniMap** to provide 'Tracked Quest' POIs.

## Known Issues

- When transitioning from an external area to external area (such as from an Inn to a Courtyard where there is no change in 'current map'), the "Tracked Quest" POI may not refresh. This can be worked around with a `/reloadui`.

-- When a quest has multiple choices, multiple NPCs or multiple interaction sites the current implementation will select only one of them, and the selection is based on the natural order of game data (ie. may appear random/different between runs/users.)

## Planned

-- Multi-Location 'Tracked Quest' Pips (many quests have multiple NPCs or interaction sites, this would allow all to be seen.)

-- Quest catalog for more than just "Tracked Quest".

## Installation

Open the Archive and copy the **X4D_Quest** folder into **%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Elder Scrolls Online\live\Addons\** folder.

If ESO is already running, execute **/reloadui** command.
