# X4D **Bank**

X4D Bank is LibStub-compatible Add-On that performs regular Bank deposits.

## Features

* Auto-Deposit Gold, either fixed amount or percentage of carried.
* Specify a Reserve Amount.
* Specify Deposit Down-Time, such as depositing only once an hour.

## Planned Features

* Display own output, currently relies on X4D Loot for displaying Balance Changes.
* Auto-Deposit Items (fill incomplete stacks, start new stacks) -- currently not possible due to API being 'protected.' -- code is already written, though, in the event ZO lifts the restriction.
