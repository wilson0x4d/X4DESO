# X4D **Vendors**

A LibStub-compatible Add-on that interacts with Vendors and Fences, performing Laundering and Sales on your behalf.


## Features

- Options to Auto-Sell/Launder Items by Pattern Matching (pattern matching is identical to 'Bank Ignore List')
- Tracks Money In, Money Out, and reports results of Auto-Sell/Launder (if any)


## Planned

- 'Vendor Action' Options by Item Type, configured similar to Bank Addon (i.e. via drop-downs.) 
- Option to Auto-Repair Equipped/All/None


## Installation

Open the Archive and copy the **X4D_Vendors** folder into **%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Elder Scrolls Online\live\Addons\** folder.

If ESO is already running, execute **/reloadui** command.

about. :)


## Donations

I hope you enjoy using my add-ons as much as I enjoy creating them. If you want to show 
your support and donate :D I can always use in-game gold and items, and they're easy 
things to come by.

I am also a firm believer in Bitcoin, so if you really want to put a smile on my face 
send a Bitcoin donation (of ANY amount!) to <b><a href="bitcoin:1PeRYfrygTEo3VuJCQaZL5A43hrssRTNVH">1PeRYfrygTEo3VuJCQaZL5A43hrssRTNVH</a></b>,
you can use a service like <a href="https://www.coinbase.com">Coinbase</a> to purchase 
and send bitcoin if you don't already have a bitcoin wallet.
