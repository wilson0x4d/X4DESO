## Donations

I hope you enjoy using my add-ons as much as I enjoy creating them. If you want to show 
your support and donate :D I can always use in-game gold and items, and they're easy 
things to come by.

I am also a firm believer in Bitcoin, so if you really want to put a smile on my face 
send a Bitcoin donation (of ANY amount!) to <b><a href="bitcoin:1PeRYfrygTEo3VuJCQaZL5A43hrssRTNVH">1PeRYfrygTEo3VuJCQaZL5A43hrssRTNVH</a></b>,
you can use a service like <a href="https://www.coinbase.com">Coinbase</a> to purchase 
and send bitcoin if you don't already have a bitcoin wallet.
