# X4D **Mail**

X4D Mail is LibStub-compatible Add-On that provides minor Mail enhancements.

## Features

* Auto-Accept Attachments from Mail
* Auto-Delete 'System Generated' Mail after all attachments have been accepted, after all attachments are received, this includes message from Crown Store, Guild Store and Hirelings. (Does NOT affect messages from Customer Support, nor other users!)
* Integrated into **X4D LibAntiSpam** to Auto-Delete Gold Seller Mail. (Disabled by default.)

## Installation

Open the Archive and copy the **X4D_Bank** folder into **%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Elder Scrolls Online\live\Addons\** folder.

## Support, Assistance, and Bug Reports

You can file a bug by commenting on the add-ons at <a href="http://www.esoui.com/downloads/author-4678.html">ESOUI.COM</a>.

You can send me **in-game mail** (not a /tell) if you prefer. I can be found on NA 
servers as Maekir@wilson0x4d, and feel free to say hello if you see me wandering 
about. :)


## Donations

I hope you enjoy using my add-ons as much as I do creating them. If you want to show 
your support and donate :D I can always use in-game gold and items, and they're easy 
things to come by.

I am also a firm believer in Bitcoin, so if you really want to put a smile on my face, 
send a Bitcoin donation (of ANY amount!) to <b><a href="bitcoin:1PeRYfrygTEo3VuJCQaZL5A43hrssRTNVH">1PeRYfrygTEo3VuJCQaZL5A43hrssRTNVH</a></b>,
you can use a service like <a href="https://www.coinbase.com">Coinbase</a> to purchase 
and send bitcoin if you don't already have a bitcoin wallet.
