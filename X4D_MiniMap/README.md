# X4D **MiniMap**

X4D MiniMap is a UI Mod which adds a simple MiniMap to the game.

## Features

- MiniMap Anchored to bottom-right of display.
- Map/Zone and Location Name
- Player Position

## Known Issues

-- Occasionally a map will appear with incorrect scaling/size, while POIs/etc appear with their correct scaling/size and location. You may be able to work around this issue by performing a `/reloadui`, if that fails then a hard reset of the maps DB can be performed followed by `/reloadui` but this is extreme. In most cases waiting 5 minutes for a map refresh is sufficient/preferred.

## Planned

- Additional POIs
- Zoom In/Out
- Moving
- Resizing
- MiniCompass (Outer Border with Pips)
- Other (Nodes, Mob Levels, etc)
- Rotation
- Fencing / Boundaries

## Installation

Open the Archive and copy the **X4D_MiniMap** folder into **%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Elder Scrolls Online\live\Addons\** folder.

If ESO is already running, execute **/reloadui** command.
